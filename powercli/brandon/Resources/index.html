					SANDBOX is the 1/c Electrical Engineering Capstone project by 
					<b>Brandon Ledford</b> and <b>John Hammond</b>.
				</p>

				<p>
					The ultimate goal is to provide a solution for the Coast Guard to easily create a dynamic cyber range or IT testbed. Essentially, this means being able to rapidly deploy any number of virtual machines and have the ability to customize and provision them without ever interacting with them. Imagine drawing a picture of an IT network, clicking a button, and in a matter of minutes... it exists!
				</p>
				<p>
					This offers the functionality to not only create a battlefield for cyber warriors to test their abilities and sharpen their skills against a number of technologies, it also lets a system administrator test the effects of a new update or patch.
